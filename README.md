### Python programming homework challenge for SHO level data engineering interview 17/09/2021 - 01/09/2021

The challenge is simple. In the modern NHS we are supposed to be going paper-light and carbon neutral. Most NHS trusts have opted to scan their text in typically as lovely PDF's. This is sort-of-ok for humans to read as long as clinic letters don't resemble 'War and Peace' but substantially inadequate for machines who cannot natively perceive text in an image. Instructions are:

1) The challenge is to build a simple application which can take in the contents in the image folder and digitize the text contained therein. I would never set a challenge which I haven't already solved to a reasonable level and I guarantee the solution to this problem is not particularly challenging with a bit of reading. 

2) Scalability is not important here - this is about creating a simple application using **Python** to solve a small demonstration problem. You can use any packages or API's you want. The data is all entirely fictious psuedodata. You can use any kind of Python tool that you want.

3) Marking is primarily focused on the way the problem was solved. Please fork/download this repository as the base and when finished upload your solution to whatever repository you choose (my favourite is normally Gitlab) and share access with me privately at the email address sent to you prior. If you want to do anything like attempt word tagging then you can but this is optional.

4) Deadline for submission is 1st October 2021. Even if you can't fully solve the problem I still recommend submitting whatever you have been able to complete.

Good luck!
